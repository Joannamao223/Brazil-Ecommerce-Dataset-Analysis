# Brazil-Ecommerce-Dataset-Analysis
*Summary:
  With the change of e-commerce to the retail format, data has become the "core" of enterprises that can become enterprises. This project uses Python to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Brazilian e-commerce data set. It is hoped that enterprises can implement data analysis in the field of e-commerce, and explore the power data analysis of the next level. It is completed in 4 steps: asking questions and understanding data→potential clues→building model→summary and suggestions.
  
*Conclusion:
  From data analysis, we can probably understand the basic characteristics of the data set. The data set contains 99441 order information of 99441 users (one order information for each user), and the time span is from 2016-09-04 to 2018-10-17.
  The average customer price of the platform is 160 reais, but more than 50% of the platform products are priced below 75 reais. The price of the product cannot fully consume the purchasing power of the user, resulting in a waste of the purchasing power of the user, and the sales strategy and price strategy of the platform need to be adjusted in time.
  The platform’s negative review rate has reached 15%, more than 80% of orders have a response time of more than 10 minutes, and 50% of orders have a completion cycle of more than 10 days. These three indicators all reflect serious problems in platform management. We must strengthen platform product quality and employee services Timely management improves the quality of products and services and enhances user satisfaction.
  The active time of customers has a relatively obvious time period. The user activity is high from 10:00 to 23:00 every day, and the user activity from January to August is much higher than that from September to December. The platform must strictly follow the distribution of user active time and strengthen interaction with users , Pay attention to the timing and seasonality of promotional activities.

## General Information
The essence of e-commerce is retail. The analysis thinking of "people, goods, market, and finance" in the retail industry is quintessential oil. For a huge data set, the analysis of "people, goods, market, and finance" will be more comprehensive, regardless of Whether it is online or offline, most of the problems in the retail industry can be considered from the four dimensions of people, goods, market, and finance.
This project uses Python to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Brazilian e-commerce data set. It is hoped that enterprises can implement data analysis in the field of e-commerce, and explore the power data analysis of the next level.

## Room for Improvement
In this project I have done some basic analysis for the Brazilian e-commerce data set, I think it will be more useful if we can do some forcast of the related marketplace.

Room for improvement:
- Build a model to do the sales predict
- Build a model to do the Customer segmentation and portrait
